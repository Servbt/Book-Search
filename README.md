# Book Collecting database

## Things to work on

So far this application can compile and use the api to search for books, but it seems like the routing for reaching some of the functionality I want is off.
Definitely need to come back on this one to work on fixing the deployment of the application, routing for some requests made to the server, and adding in the functionality for a  proxy so that graphql can work properly.
